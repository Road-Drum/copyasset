Batch script to copy Windows Spotlight wallpaper

## Usage
Run the script in cmd or just double click it

## Known limitations
Inability to recognize file type and metadata which allows icon files to be copied along with Spotlight wallpapers. Filtering is done by skipping files smaller than 100kB which is the smallest wallpaper images that I can find
